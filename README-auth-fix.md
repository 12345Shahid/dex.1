# Authentication and Database Schema Fixes

This document explains how to fix authentication issues and database schema problems in the Project Planner Pro application.

## Authentication Issues

### The Problem

The system was encountering issues with authentication because:

1. The password comparison mechanism was expecting passwords to be stored in a specific secure format (`hash.salt`).
2. Some user passwords were stored in a different format, causing authentication to fail even with correct credentials.

### The Solution Implemented

We've updated the authentication system to:

1. Accept both formats of passwords (secure and plain text) for backward compatibility
2. Automatically upgrade passwords to the secure format when users log in successfully
3. Add better logging to help diagnose login issues

### How to Fix User Accounts

If a user is still having trouble logging in, you can:

1. Reset their password in the database directly using the SQL function we created:

```sql
-- Reset a user's password to a known value (e.g., "newpassword123")
SELECT secure_user_password(
  (SELECT id FROM users WHERE username = 'shahidhasanpollob@gmail.com'), 
  'newpassword123'
);
```

## Database Schema Issues

### Missing Columns

The system was experiencing errors because:

1. The `parent_id` column was missing from the `folders` table
2. The `is_favorite` column was missing from the `files` table

### How to Fix the Schema

Run the SQL script `fix-database-schema.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor to add the missing columns and functions.

The script will:

1. Add the `parent_id` column to the `folders` table
2. Add the `is_favorite` column to the `files` table 
3. Create an index for faster queries on favorites
4. Create a function to securely update user passwords

### Verifying the Fix

After running the script:

1. Restart the application server
2. Check that the warning messages about missing columns no longer appear in the logs
3. Test the login functionality to ensure users can log in correctly

## Long-term Recommendations

1. **Implement Password Reset**: Add a proper "Forgot Password" feature so users can reset their own passwords
2. **Database Migrations**: Use a migration system to manage database schema changes
3. **Password Storage**: Ensure all new user accounts use the secure password storage format
